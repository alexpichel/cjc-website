<h3 style="text-align: center;">The Commission</h3>
<p class="mission">The Criminal Justice Commission's new interactive data connects public safety officials and policy makers with up-to-date information on local criminal justice systems. This data will help you get a visual idea of criminal justice trends in Oregon.  It is our hope that this information will be useful in local discussions and decision making about public safety resources. This is just the beginning of what we want to make available. As you can see by the buttons below tagged “coming soon”, we are actively working behind the scenes to expand the information available to you. We look forward to you digging into these charts, and value your feedback about what is useful and what would make this site even better.</p>

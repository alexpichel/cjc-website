							<p><strong>Description: </strong>
								(1) Commission staff will evaluate each county’s application based on the criteria provided in OAR 213‐060‐0060, and will make recommendations to the Grant Review Committee. If the recommendation by staff to the Grant Review Committee would be to not fund the grant proposal, the Commission staff shall first work with applicant to attempt to rehabilitate the application.
								(2) The Grant Review Committee will review each county’s grant application and the recommendations of Commission staff, and notify the Commission regarding which applications it has approved. The Grant Review Committee may reject portions of the application that fail to meet the goals of justice reinvestment.  Approval by the Grant Review Committee is subject to final approval by the Commission.
								(3) The Commission will review and evaluate the approvals of the Grant Review Committee, and
								provide a final approval in whole or in part. The Commission  will notify applicants of the decision of the Commission within 60 days from the expiration of the grant application deadline. If there are extenuating circumstances, the Commission may, in its sole discretion, extend the deadline for award notification. The Commission will prepare a grant award agreement for each grant awarded, which will set forth the terms, conditions, and requirements of the grant. The Commission may issue a provisional one year award with continued funding contingent upon improved performance and progress toward the goals of justice reinvestment.
								(4) The Commission may amend a grant awarded under this rule. After the grant is awarded the Commission may amend the amount originally awarded based on non‐compliance with the terms of the award. If the recommendation by staff to the Commission would be not to continue to fund the grant proposal, the Commission staff shall first work with applicant to attempt to rehabilitate the application.

								(3) A county selected for a randomized controlled trial or other outcome evaluation shall contract with the Commission, or an entity approved by the Commission, to conduct such randomized controlled trial or other outcome evaluation.
								(4) Any randomized controlled trial or other outcome evaluation funds not allocated or budgeted by July 1 of an even-numbered year shall be dispersed back to the counties participating in the Justice Reinvestment Grant Program according to the formula provided in ORS 423.483.

								(6) The Commission will report the results of evaluations conducted under this rule to a committee of the Legislative Assembly related to the judiciary and the Office of the Governor, and will post the report on the Commission’s website.
								(7) In choosing programs for randomized controlled trials or other outcome evaluations, the Commission will consider the following factors:
									(a) The proposed program is promising and has the capability of being reproduced in other counties.
									(b) The proposed program is capable of being evaluated through randomized controlled trials when taking into account sample size and other practical requirements.
									(c) The proposed randomized controlled trial will meet the requirements of the institutional
									review board process.
									(d) Studying the program will benefit the State and more broadly the field of criminal justice by adding to the body of knowledge currently available.

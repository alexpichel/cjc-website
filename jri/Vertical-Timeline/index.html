				<h2>2013</h2>
				<p>Following the passage of HB 3194, Oregon was eligible to apply and was accepted into Phase II of JRI in December 2013. This phase of JRI focuses on the implementation of HB 3194. CJC is receiving technical assistance in this phase from the Vera Institute.</p>

				<p>The entire first allocation of grant funds, a total of $15 million, was distributed to the all 36 counties by January 2014.</p>

				<p>HB 3194 stated goals:

					<ul>
						<li>Reduce recidivism</li>
						<li>Reduce prison utilization</li>
						<li>Increase public safety</li>
						<li>Hold offenders accountable</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>HB3194 also created the following committees:

				<h2>2012</h2>
				<p>In May 2012, Oregon joined BJA's Justice Reinvestment Initiative (JRI) and the Commission on Public Safety was reconvened with an expanded membership. The PEW Center for the States provided technical assistance to the Commission and the CJC staffed it.</p>

				<p>The work of the 2012 Commission on Public Safety culminated in a final report to the Governor. The report examined the key drivers of the state's growing corrections budget and resulted in several policy recommendations to the legislature. In July 2013, the Oregon Legislature enacted HB 3194, codifying 13 of the 19 proposed policy options. The JRI legislation is projected to reduced the growth of the prison population by 870 inmates over the next 10 years. These future savings, in the form of avoided costs, are to be invested, as grants, in the local public safety systems.</p>

				<h2>2011</h2>
				<a href="http://www.oregon.gov/cjc/justicereinvestment/Documents/eo_1106.pdf">Governor's Commission on Public Safety</a>
				<p>
				In 2011, Governor Kitzhaber appointed the Commission on Public Safety, a bipartisan, interagency work group tasked with analyzing the state's corrections and sentencing policies to understand how they effected the growth of Oregon's prison population. While the findings from this group's analysis did not lead to legislation, it paved the way for future discourse on criminal justice reform.</p>

				<h2>2010</h2>
				<p>Justice Reinvestment is an approach to spending criminal justice resources more effectively. Generally, justice reinvestment, looks at two types of criminal justice data - population data and cost data. Oregon's data, from 2000 to 2010, showed an incarceration rate that grew four times of the national average. Over that same period, Oregon's prison population increased by nearly 50%, grew to more than 14,000 inmates with a total biennial corrections budget over $1.4 billion.</p>

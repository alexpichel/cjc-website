			<p class="well mission">Between 2000 and 2010, Oregon's prison rate increased by nearly 50% growing to 14,000 inmates with a total biennial corrections budget over $1.4 billion. Justice Reinvestment is an approach to spending resources more effectively with the goals of reducing recidivism, decreasing prison use, protecting the public and holding offenders accountable.

<ul>
	<li>As of January 2015, the net-cost avoidance for HB3194 is $58.5 million. Savings will be calculated again for the upcoming biennium.</li>
	<li>As of March 2016, the prison population was 100 prison beds below the April 2015 prison forecast, and 417 prison beds below the April 2013 forecast.</li>
	<li>On average 100 inmates per month particpate in Short Term Transitional Leave (STTL).</li>
	<li>STTL offenders have a failure-rate of only 5%, and lower one-year recidivism rates than inmates who were statutorily eligible but did not receive STTL. <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/cjc/data/Pages/sttl.aspx">View Here</a></li>
	<li>Counties will receive their year two for the biennium in August.</li>
	<li>CJC is planning the second justice reinvestment summit for February 2017.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h4 id="toc_1">2015</h4>

<ul>
	<li>The second allocation of grant funds, a total of $38.7 million was distributed to all 36 counties. Counties received their year one funds in December. <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/cjc/data/Pages/jri.aspx">View Here</a></li>
	<li>10% of these funds were reserved for community-based crime victim services in each county. <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/cjc/data/Pages/victims.aspx">View Here</a></li>
	<li>3% of the funds were reserved for studying local programs.</li>
	<li>CJC held the first <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/cjc/summit">Justice Reinvestment Summit</a> in April.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h4 id="toc_2">2013</h4>

<p>Following the passage of HB 3194, Oregon was eligible to apply and was accepted into Phase II of JRI in December 2013. This phase of JRI focuses on the implementation of HB 3194. CJC is receiving technical assistance in this phase from the Vera Institute.</p>

<p>The entire first allocation of grant funds, a total of $15 million, was distributed to the all 36 counties by January 2014.</p>

<p>HB 3194 stated goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce recidivism</li>
<li>Reduce prison utilization</li>
<li>Increase public safety</li>
<li>Hold offenders accountable</li>
</ul>

<p>HB3194 also created the following committees:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.oregon.gov/cjc/justicereinvestment/Pages/default.aspx#jri-pstf">Public Safety Task Force</a> to oversee the implementation of HB3194/JRI </p>

<p>and</p>

<p><a href="http://www.oregon.gov/cjc/justicereinvestment/Pages/default.aspx#jri-grants">Grant Review Committee</a> to review counties Justice Reinvestment grant applications.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="toc_3">2012</h4>

<p>In May 2012, Oregon joined BJA&#39;s Justice Reinvestment Initiative (JRI) and the Commission on Public Safety was reconvened with an expanded membership. The PEW Center for the States provided technical assistance to the Commission and the CJC staffed it.</p>

<p>The work of the 2012 Commission on Public Safety culminated in a final report to the Governor. The report examined the key drivers of the state&#39;s growing corrections budget and resulted in several policy recommendations to the legislature. In July 2013, the Oregon Legislature enacted HB 3194, codifying 13 of the 19 proposed policy options. The JRI legislation is projected to reduced the growth of the prison population by 870 inmates over the next 10 years. These future savings, in the form of avoided costs, are to be invested, as grants, in the local public safety systems.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.oregon.gov/cjc/justicereinvestment/Documents/eo_1106.pdf">Governor&#39;s Commission on Public Safety</a></p>

<p>In 2011, Governor Kitzhaber appointed the Commission on Public Safety, a bipartisan, interagency work group tasked with analyzing the state&#39;s corrections and sentencing policies to understand how they effected the growth of Oregon&#39;s prison population. While the findings from this group&#39;s analysis did not lead to legislation, it paved the way for future discourse on criminal justice reform.</p>

<hr>
<h4 id="toc_5">2010</h4>

<p>Justice Reinvestment is an approach to spending criminal justice resources more effectively. Generally, justice reinvestment, looks at two types of criminal justice data - population data and cost data. Oregon&#39;s data, from 2000 to 2010, showed an incarceration rate that grew four times of the national average. Over that same period, Oregon&#39;s prison population increased by nearly 50%, grew to more than 14,000 inmates with a total biennial corrections budget over $1.4 billion</p>

				<p>Grant Program funds must be spent on community-based sanctions, services and programs. Community-based programs include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Work release programs</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Structured transitional leave programs</p>
					</li>

				<p><strong>Justice Reinvestment Funds 10% for Community-Based Victim Services</strong></p>

				<p>While nearly half the country has engaged in a Justice Reinvestment processes, Oregon is the first state to dedicate at least 10% of Justice Reinvestment funds to victim services programs. HB 3194 specifically stated that funding would be directed to community-based victim services. This FAQ will answer questions you may have about that funding.</p>

				<p><strong>What are Community-based Nonprofit Victim Services Programs?</strong></p>

				<p>Community-based nonprofit victim services programs provide comprehensive services to victims, such as accessing safe emergency shelter, crisis counseling, court and medical accompaniment, safety planning, obtaining protective orders, and applying for benefits. Programs may also provide support groups, assistance in returning to school, finding living wage jobs, support finding safe and affordable housing, family support services, and prevention classes.</p>

				<p>Services are available before, during, and after a criminal case. Services are also available if the victim hasn't reported to law enforcement and if there is no criminal case at all.</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p><strong>Community-base Victim Services</strong></p>

					<ul>
						<li>Assist victims who report the crime as well as victims who do not</li>
						<li>Provide advocacy to help victims rebuild their lives (crisis line; emergency shelter; crisis counseling; safety planning; support groups; education and violence prevention; advocacy; assistance navigating criminal justice, civil justice and human services processes)</li>
						<li>Services are focused on victim safety, empowerment, and restoration</li>
						<li>Services are available on an on-going basis</li>
					</ul>

					<p><strong>System-based Victim Services</strong></p>

					<ul>
						<li>Assist victims whose cases are processed through the justice system</li>
						<li>Provides advocacy to help victims access their rights (information; notification of court proceedings; court accompaniment; assistance with victim impact statements, restitution and applying for compensation)</li>
						<li>Services are focused on victim safety and access to justice system and case-specific information</li>
						<li>Services are typically limited to the duration of the criminal justice process</li>
					</ul>
				</blockquote>

				<p><strong>What are examples of community-based victim services?</strong></p>

				<p>Community-based victim services should have serving victims of crime as part of their mission statement. Examples of community-based nonprofit victim services programs include domestic and sexual violence services programs, services for murder victim family members, assistance for victims of DUII-related crashes, services for child victims, and restorative justice programs (if appropriate).</p>

				<p><strong>Is the 10% tied to the Justice Reinvestment offender population?</strong></p>

				<p>No. Crime victims served through the 10% are not expected to be tied to or the victims of offenders who are part of the HB 3194 population or are being served through Justice Reinvestment. This is an opportunity to provide innovative services to underserved crime victims in your community.</p>

				<p><strong>Can system-based victim services programs receive funding through the 10%?</strong></p>

				<p>No, but system-based victim services programs can receive funding through the other 90% of their County's Justice Reinvestment award.</p>

				<p><strong>How are applications for the 10% evaluated?</strong></p>

				<p>Each grant application will be evaluated based ont he following <em>(JR Grant Rules 213-060-0060(2)(f))</em>:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Demonstrated need for the proposed services in the community to be served by the applicant with emphasis on services that target marginalized, underserved populations.</li>
					<li>Services address access barriers, such as but not limited to: language, literacy, disability, cultural practices and transportation issues.</li>
					<li>Funding increases capacity for areas where services are difficult to access, limited or non-existent.</li>
					<li>Demonstration that the award will be invested in trauma-informed services.</li>
					<li>Data collection, including but not limited to, demographic information of victims served.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>How do I find a community-based nonprofit victim services program that serves my county?</strong></p>

				<p>Many community-based nonprofit victim services programs serve multiple counties. The following statewide organizations can help you get in touch with your local programs:</p>

			<div class="well">

				<p>Statewide RIC (Regional Implementation Council) meetings occur on a quarterly basis. These meetings allow for knowledge sharing and collaboration around Justice Reinvestment Program implementation and innovation. The Criminal Justice Commission presents statewide and county level prison use, as well as other crucial areas of Justice Reinvestment including short-term transitional leave. The state has been divided into four regions shown in the map below. CJC staff travel to each region to conduct the RIC meetings, and this helps to facilitate regional information sharing and alleviates some of the travel burden to meet on a regular basis. Ross Caldwell is the Justice Reinvestment Liaison for the CJC who schedules and conducts these quarterly meetings and can be reached at <a href="mailto:ross.caldwell@oregon.gov">ross.caldwell@oregon.gov</a>.</p>

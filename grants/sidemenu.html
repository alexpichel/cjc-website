				  disbursement.</p>

				  <p><strong>ii</strong>. The Justice Reinvestment Account (“<em>Account</em>”) has received <br>

				  commission, board, or other administrative agency or any provision of <br>

				  is a party or by which Grantee or any of its properties may be bound <br>
				  or affected. No authorization, consent, license, approval of, filing <br>

				  regulatory or supervisory authority is required for the execution, <br>
				  delivery or performance by Grantee of this Agreement.</p>

				  <p><strong>b. Binding Obligation.</strong> This Agreement has been duly executed and <br>

				  share or part of this Agreement or any benefit arising therefrom.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p><strong>8. Records Maintenance and Access; Audit</strong>.</p>

				<blockquote>
				  <p><strong>a. Records, Access to Records and Facilities</strong>. Grantee shall make <br>
				  and retain proper and complete books of record and account and <br>
				  maintain all fiscal records related to this Agreement and the Project <br>
				  in accordance with all applicable generally accepted accounting <br>
				  principles, generally accepted governmental auditing standards and <br>
				  state minimum standards for audits of municipal corporations. Grantee <br>
				  shall ensure that each of its subgrantees and subcontractors complies <br>
				  with these requirements, as applicable. CJC, the Secretary of State of <br>
				  the State of Oregon (“<em>Secretary</em>”) and their duly authorized <br>
				  representatives shall have access to the books, documents, papers and <br>
				  records of Grantee that are directly related to this Agreement, the <br>
				  Grant Funds provided hereunder, or the Project for the purpose of <br>
				  making audits and examinations. In addition, CJC, the Secretary and <br>
				  their duly authorized representatives may make and retain excerpts, <br>
				  copies, and transcriptions of the foregoing books, documents, papers, <br>
				  and records. Grantee shall permit authorized representatives of CJC <br>
				  and the Secretary to perform site reviews of the Project, and to <br>

				  and records until the questions are resolved.</p>

				  <p><strong>c. Expenditure Records.</strong> Grantee shall document the expenditure of <br>
				  all Grant Funds disbursed by CJC under this Agreement. Grantee shall <br>
				  create and maintain all expenditure records in accordance with <br>
				  generally accepted accounting principles and in sufficient detail to <br>
				  permit CJC to verify how the moneys were expended.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p><strong>9. Grantee Sub agreements and Procurements</strong></p>

				<blockquote>
				  <p><strong>a. Sub agreements.</strong> Grantee may enter into agreements with <br>
				  subgrantees, contractors or subcontractors (collectively, “sub <br>
				  agreements”) for performance of the Project.</p>

				  <p><strong>i.</strong> All sub agreements must be in writing and executed by Grantee <br>
				  and must incorporate and pass through all of the applicable <br>
				  requirements of this Agreement to the other party or parties to the <br>
				  sub agreement(s). Use of a sub agreement does not relieve Grantee of <br>
				  its responsibilities under this Agreement.</p>

				  <p><strong>ii.</strong> Grantee agrees to provide CJC with a copy of any signed sub <br>
				  agreement upon request by CJC. Any substantial breach of a term or <br>
				  condition of a sub agreement relating to funds covered by this <br>
				  Agreement must be reported by Grantee to CJC within ten (10) days of <br>
				  its being discovered.</p>

				  <p><strong>b.</strong> <strong>Sub agreement indemnity; insurance. </strong></p>

				  <p>Each sub agreement shall require the other party to such sub <br>
				  agreement, if that party is not a unit of local government as defined <br>
				  in ORS 190.003 or a unit of state government as defined in ORS <br>
				  174.111, to indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless CJC and its <br>
				  officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, <br>
				  actions, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses, including <br>
				  attorneys’ fees, arising from a tort, as now or hereafter defined in <br>
				  ORS 30.260, caused, or alleged to be caused, in whole or in part, by <br>
				  the negligent or willful acts or omissions of the other party to <br>
				  Grantee’s sub agreement or any of such party’s officers, employees, <br>
				  agents, subgrantees or subcontractors (“Claims”). It is the specific <br>
				  intention of the Parties that CJC shall, in all instances, except for <br>
				  Claims arising solely from the negligent or willful acts or omissions <br>
				  of CJC, be indemnified by the other party to Grantee’s sub agreement <br>
				  from and against any and all Claims.</p>

				  <p>Any such indemnification shall also provide that neither Grantee’s <br>
				  subgrantee(s), contractor(s) nor subcontractor(s), nor any attorney <br>
				  engaged by Grantee’s subgrantee(s), contractor(s) nor subcontractor(s) <br>
				  shall defend any claim in the name of the State or any agency of the <br>
				  State of Oregon, nor purport to act as legal representative of the <br>
				  State of Oregon or any of its agencies, without the prior written <br>
				  consent of the Oregon Attorney General. The State may, at any time at <br>
				  its election, assume its own defense and settlement in the event that <br>
				  it determines that Grantee’s subgrantee, subcontractor or contractor <br>
				  is prohibited from defending State, that Grantee’s subgrantee, <br>
				  subcontractor or contractor is not adequately defending State’s <br>
				  interests, that an important governmental principle is at issue, or <br>
				  that it is in the best interests of State to do so. State reserves all <br>
				  rights to pursue claims it may have against Grantee’s subgrantee, <br>
				  subcontractor or contractor if State elects to assume its own defense.</p>

				  <p>Grantee shall require the other party or parties to each of its <br>
				  subagreements that are not units of local government as defined in ORS <br>
				  190.003 to obtain and maintain insurance of the types and in the <br>
				  amounts provided in Exhibit B to this Agreement.</p>

				  <p><strong>c. Procurements. </strong></p>

				  <p>Grantee shall make purchases of any equipment, materials, or services <br>
				  for the Project under procedures that comply with Oregon law, <br>
				  including all applicable provisions of the Oregon Public Contracting <br>
				  Code and rules.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p><strong>10. Termination</strong></p>

				<blockquote>
				  <p><strong>a. Termination by CJC.</strong> CJC may terminate this Agreement effective <br>
				  upon delivery of written notice of termination to Grantee, or at such <br>
				  later date as may be established by CJC in such written notice, if:</p>

				  <p><strong>i.</strong> Grantee fails to perform the Project within the time specified <br>
				  herein or any extension thereof or commencement, continuation or <br>
				  timely completion of the Project by Grantee is, for any reason, <br>
				  rendered improbable, impossible, or illegal; or</p>

				  <p><strong>ii.</strong> Grantee fails to comply with any of the terms of this <br>
				  Agreement or fails to perform any of its obligations under this <br>
				  Agreement, including but not limited to failure to meet, to the <br>
				  satisfaction of CJC, any of its outcome or performance measures(as <br>
				  proposed in its Application and agreed to by CJC) and achieved the <br>
				  criteria as outlined in OAR 213-060-0060, including but not limited to <br>
				  reduction of prison utilization; or</p>

				  <p><strong>iii.</strong> CJC fails to receive funding, appropriations, limitations or <br>
				  other expenditure authority sufficient to allow CJC, in the exercise <br>
				  of its reasonable administrative discretion, to continue to make <br>
				  payments for performance of this Agreement; or</p>

				  <p><strong>iv.</strong> The Justice Reinvestment Account fails to receive funding, <br>
				  appropriations, limitations or other expenditure authority sufficient <br>
				  to allow CJC, in the exercise of its reasonable administrative <br>
				  discretion, to continue to make payments for performance of this <br>
				  Agreement; or</p>

				  <p><strong>v.</strong> Grantor has been notified by the Oregon Legislature or <br>
				  otherwise that the funds in the Account will be reduced for the <br>
				  biennium in which this Agreement becomes effective or for any biennium <br>
				  thereafter;</p>

				  <p><strong>vi.</strong> Federal or state laws, rules, regulations or guidelines are <br>
				  modified or interpreted in such a way that the Project is no longer <br>
				  allowable or no longer eligible for funding under this Agreement; or</p>

				  <p><strong>vii.</strong> The Project would not produce results commensurate with the <br>
				  further expenditure of funds.<strong>b. Remedies of CJC.</strong> In the event of <br>
				  termination by CJC pursuant to Section 10.a.i. or ii. above, CJC may <br>
				  pursue any remedies available under this Agreement and may take <br>
				  whatever other action at law or in equity that may appear to CJC to be <br>
				  necessary or desirable to enforce the performance and observance of <br>
				  any duty, covenant, obligation or agreement of Grantee under this <br>
				  Agreement, including but not limited to the following remedies and <br>
				  actions:</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p><strong>i.</strong> Terminating all further disbursements of Grant Funds.</p>

				<p><strong>ii.</strong> Demanding repayment of all or a portion of the Grant moneys <br>
				previously disbursed to Grantee and all interest earned by Grantee on <br>
				those Grant moneys and upon notice to Grantee the same shall become <br>
				immediately due and payable by Grantee without further notice or demand.</p>

				<p><strong>iii.</strong> Declaring Grantee ineligible to receive future awards from CJC.</p>

				<p><strong>iv.</strong> Applying amounts otherwise due to Grantee from the State of <br>
				Oregon to payment of the amounts due under this Agreement, as provided <br>

				<blockquote>
				  <p><strong>c. Termination by Grantee.</strong> Grantee may terminate this Agreement <br>
				  effective upon delivery of written notice of termination to CJC, or at <br>
				  such later date as may be established by Grantee in such written <br>
				  notice, if:</p>

				  <p><strong>i.</strong> The requisite local funding to continue the Project becomes <br>
				  unavailable to Grantee or Grantee is unable to continue implementation <br>
				  of the Project as a result of circumstances that were not reasonably <br>
				  anticipated by Grantee at the time it executed this Agreement and that <br>
				  are beyond Grantee’s reasonable control; or</p>

				  <p><strong>ii.</strong> Federal or state laws, rules, regulations or guidelines are <br>
				  modified or interpreted in such a way that the Project is no longer <br>
				  allowable or no longer eligible for funding under this Agreement.</p>

				  <p>Upon termination of this Agreement by Grantee under this subsection c, <br>
				  CJC may end all further disbursements of Grant Funds, but Grantee <br>
				  shall not be required to repay to CJC any Grant Funds previously <br>
				  disbursed to and expended by Grantee in accordance with the terms and <br>
				  conditions of this Agreement.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p><strong>11. General Provisions</strong></p>

				<blockquote>
				  <p><strong>a. Contribution.</strong> If any third party makes any claim or brings any <br>
				  action, suit or proceeding alleging a tort as now or hereafter defined <br>
				  in ORS 30.260 (“Third Party Claim”) against CJC or Grantee with <br>
				  respect to which the other Party may have liability, the notified <br>
				  Party must promptly notify the other Party in writing of the Third <br>
				  Party Claim and deliver to the other Party a copy of the claim, <br>
				  process, and all legal pleadings with respect to the Third Party <br>
				  Claim. Each Party is entitled to participate in the defense of a Third <br>
				  Party Claim, and to defend a Third Party Claim with counsel of its own <br>
				  choosing. Receipt by a Party of the notice and copies required in this <br>
				  paragraph and meaningful opportunity for the Party to participate in <br>
				  the investigation, defense and settlement of the Third Party Claim <br>
				  with counsel of its own choosing are conditions precedent to that <br>
				  Party’s liability with respect to the Third Party Claim.</p>

				  <p>With respect to a Third Party Claim for which CJC is jointly liable <br>
				  with Grantee (or would be if joined in the Third Party Claim ), CJC <br>
				  shall contribute to the amount of expenses (including attorneys’ <br>
				  fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and <br>
				  reasonably incurred and paid or payable by Grantee in such proportion <br>
				  as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the CJC on the one <br>
				  hand and of the Grantee on the other hand in connection with the <br>
				  events which resulted in such expenses, judgments, fines or settlement <br>
				  amounts, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The <br>
				  relative fault of CJC on the one hand and of Grantee on the other hand <br>
				  shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the Parties’ <br>
				  relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to <br>
				  correct or prevent the circumstances resulting in such expenses, <br>
				  judgments, fines or settlement amounts. CJC’s contribution amount in <br>
				  any instance is capped to the same extent it would have been capped <br>
				  under Oregon law, including the Oregon Tort Claims Act, ORS 30.260 to <br>
				  30.300, if CJC had sole liability in the proceeding.</p>

				  <p>With respect to a Third Party Claim for which Grantee is jointly <br>
				  liable with CJC (or would be if joined in the Third Party Claim), <br>
				  Grantee shall contribute to the amount of expenses (including <br>
				  attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement <br>
				  actually and reasonably incurred and paid or payable by CJC in such <br>
				  proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of Grantee <br>
				  on the one hand and of CJC on the other hand in connection with the <br>
				  events which resulted in such expenses, judgments, fines or settlement <br>
				  amounts, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The <br>
				  relative fault of Grantee on the one hand and of CJC on the other hand <br>
				  shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the Parties’ <br>
				  relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to <br>
				  correct or prevent the circumstances resulting in such expenses, <br>
				  judgments, fines or settlement amounts. Grantee’s contribution amount <br>
				  in any instance is capped to the same extent it would have been capped <br>
				  under Oregon law, including the Oregon Tort Claims Act, ORS 30.260 to <br>
				  30.300, if it had sole liability in the proceeding.</p>

				  <p><strong>b. Dispute Resolution.</strong> The Parties shall attempt in good faith to <br>
				  resolve any dispute arising out of this Agreement. In addition, the <br>
				  Parties may agree to utilize a jointly selected mediator or arbitrator <br>
				  (for non-binding arbitration) to resolve the dispute short of <br>
				  litigation.</p>

				  <p><strong>c.</strong> <strong>Amendments; Budget Changes.</strong> This Agreement may be amended <br>
				  or extended only by a written instrument signed by both Parties and <br>
				  approved as required by applicable law. Grantee may propose changes to <br>
				  the Budget in Exhibit A that do not increase the total Budget amount. <br>
				  The proposed changes to the Budget will be effective without a written <br>
				  amendment to this Agreement upon written approval by CJC delivered to <br>
				  Grantee as provided in Section 11.f.</p>

				  <p><strong>d. Duplicate Payment.</strong> Grantee is not entitled to <br>
				  compensation or any other form of duplicate, overlapping or multiple <br>
				  payments for the same work performed under this Agreement from any <br>
				  agency of the State of Oregon or the United States of America or any <br>
				  other party, organization or individual.</p>

				  <p><strong>e. No Third Party Beneficiaries.</strong> CJC and Grantee are the only <br>
				  Parties to this Agreement and are the only Parties entitled to enforce <br>
				  its terms. Nothing in this Agreement gives, is intended to give, or <br>
				  shall be construed to give or provide any benefit or right, whether <br>
				  directly or indirectly, to a third person unless such a third person <br>
				  is individually identified by name herein and expressly described as <br>
				  an intended beneficiary of the terms of this Agreement.</p>

				  <p><strong>f. Notices.</strong> Except as otherwise expressly provided in this <br>
				  Agreement, any communications between the Parties hereto or notices to <br>
				  be given hereunder shall be given in writing by personal delivery, <br>
				  facsimile, email, or mailing the same by registered or certified mail, <br>
				  postage prepaid, to Grantee Contact or CJC Contact at the address or <br>
				  number set forth on the signature page of this Agreement, or to such <br>
				  other addresses or numbers as either Party may hereafter indicate <br>
				  pursuant to this Section 11.f. Any communication or notice personally <br>
				  delivered shall be deemed to be given when actually delivered. Any <br>
				  communication or notice delivered by facsimile shall be deemed to be <br>
				  given when receipt of the transmission is generated by the <br>
				  transmitting machine, and to be effective against CJC, such facsimile <br>
				  transmission must be confirmed by telephone notice to CJC Contact. Any <br>
				  communication by email shall be deemed to be given when the recipient <br>
				  of the email acknowledges receipt of the email. The parties also may <br>
				  communicate by telephone, regular mail or other means, but such <br>
				  communications shall not be deemed notices under this Section unless <br>
				  receipt by the other party is expressly acknowledged in writing by the <br>
				  receiving party.</p>

				  <p><strong>g. Governing Law, Consent to Jurisdiction.</strong> This Agreement shall be <br>
				  governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of <br>
				  Oregon without regard to principles of conflicts of law. Any claim, <br>
				  action, suit or proceeding (collectively, “Claim”) between State (or <br>
				  any other agency or department of the State of Oregon) and Grantee <br>
				  that arises from or relates to this Agreement shall be brought and <br>
				  conducted solely and exclusively within the Circuit Court of Marion <br>
				  County in the State of Oregon. In no event shall this Section be <br>
				  construed as a waiver by the State of Oregon of any form of defense or <br>
				  immunity, whether sovereign immunity, governmental immunity, immunity <br>
				  based on the eleventh amendment to the Constitution of the United <br>
				  States or otherwise, from any Claim or from the jurisdiction of any <br>
				  court. Each party hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of <br>
				  such court, waives any objection to venue, and waives any claim that <br>
				  such forum is an inconvenient forum.</p>

				  <p><strong>h. Compliance with Law.</strong> Grantee shall comply with all federal, <br>
				  state and local laws, regulations, executive orders and ordinances <br>
				  applicable to the Agreement or to the implementation of the Project. <br>
				  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Grantee expressly <br>
				  agrees to comply with (i) Title VI of Civil Rights Act of 1964; (ii) <br>
				  Title V and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; (iii) the <br>
				  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and ORS 659A.142; (iv) all <br>
				  regulations and administrative rules established pursuant to the <br>
				  foregoing laws; and (v) all other applicable requirements of federal <br>
				  and state civil rights and rehabilitation statutes, rules and <br>
				  regulations.</p>

				  <p><strong>i. Insurance; Workers’ Compensation.</strong> All employers, including <br>
				  Grantee, that employ subject workers who provide services in the State <br>
				  of Oregon shall comply with ORS 656.017 and provide the required <br>
				  Workers’ Compensation coverage, unless such employers are exempt under <br>
				  ORS 656.126. Employer’s liability insurance with coverage limits of <br>
				  not less than $500,000 must be included. Grantee shall ensure that <br>
				  each of its subgrantee(s), contractor(s), and subcontractor(s) <br>
				  complies with these requirements.</p>

				  <p><strong>j. Independent Contractor.</strong> Grantee shall perform the Project as an <br>
				  independent contractor and not as an agent or employee of CJC. Grantee <br>
				  has no right or authority to incur or create any obligation for or <br>
				  legally bind CJC in any way. CJC cannot and will not control the means <br>
				  or manner by which Grantee performs the Project, except as <br>
				  specifically set forth in this Agreement. Grantee is responsible for <br>
				  determining the appropriate means and manner of performing the <br>
				  Project. Grantee acknowledges and agrees that Grantee is not an <br>
				  “officer”, “employee”, or “agent” of CJC, as those terms are used in <br>
				  ORS 30.265, and shall not make representations to third parties to the <br>
				  contrary.</p>

				  <p><strong>k. Severability.</strong> If any term or provision of this Agreement is <br>
				  declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal or in <br>
				  conflict with any law, the validity of the remaining terms and <br>
				  provisions shall not be affected, and the rights and obligations of <br>
				  the Parties shall be construed and enforced as if this Agreement did <br>
				  not contain the particular term or provision held to be invalid.</p>

				  <p><strong>l. Counterparts.</strong> This Agreement may be executed in two or more <br>
				  counterparts (by facsimile or otherwise), each of which is an original <br>
				  and all of which together are deemed one agreement binding on all <br>
				  Parties, notwithstanding that all Parties are not signatories to the <br>
				  same counterpart.</p>

				  <p><strong>m. Integration and Waiver.</strong> This Agreement, including all Exhibits, <br>
				  constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties on the subject <br>
				  matter hereof. There are no understandings, agreements, or <br>
				  representations, oral or written, not specified herein regarding this <br>
				  Agreement. The delay or failure of either Party to enforce any <br>
				  provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver by that <br>
				  Party of that or any other provision.</p>

				<p><strong>EXHIBIT A</strong></p>

				<p>Project Description and Budget</p>

				<p>The goal of the Criminal Justice Commission’s *Justice Reinvestment <br>
				Grant Program* is to financially support Oregon localities in fulfilling <br>
				the requirements of House Bill (HB) 3194 by reducing prison populations <br>
				and averting future prison construction; reducing recidivism through <br>
				evidence-based practices and data-driven research; increasing public <br>
				safety through collaboration; and increasing offender accountability.</p>

				<p>The Grant Program requires a data-driven approach that: (1) analyzes <br>
				criminal justice trends to understand drivers of local prison use; (2) <br>
				promotes the effective implementation of investments that increase <br>
				public safety and improve offender accountability; (3) measures the <br>
				impact of the policy changes and reinvestment resources; and (4) ties <br>
				results to funding.</p>

				<p>This Agreement funds the .</p>

				<p>Sub agreement Insurance Requirements</p>

				<blockquote>
				  <p>Grantee shall require its first tier contractor(s) that are not units <br>
				  of local government as defined in ORS 190.003, or a unit of state <br>
				  government as defined in ORS 174.111, if any, to: i) obtain <br>
				  insurance specified under TYPES AMOUNTS and meeting the requirements <br>
				  under ADDITIONAL INSURED, “TAIL” COVERAGE, and CERTIFICATES OF <br>
				  INSURANCE before the contractors perform under contracts between <br>
				  Grantee and the contractors (the “Subcontracts”), and ii) maintain the <br>
				  insurance in full force throughout the duration of the Subcontracts.  <br>
				  The insurance must be provided by insurance companies or entities that <br>
				  are authorized to transact the business of insurance and issue <br>
				  coverage in the State of and that are acceptable to CJC.  Grantee <br>
				  shall not authorize contractors to begin work under the Subcontracts <br>
				  until the insurance is in full force.  Thereafter, Grantee shall <br>
				  monitor continued compliance with the insurance requirements on an <br>
				  annual or more frequent basis.  Grantee shall incorporate appropriate <br>
				  provisions in the Subcontracts permitting it to enforce contractor <br>
				  compliance with the insurance requirements and shall take all <br>
				  reasonable steps to enforce such compliance.  Examples of “reasonable <br>
				  steps” include issuing stop work orders (or the equivalent) until the <br>
				  insurance is in full force or terminating the Subcontracts as <br>
				  permitted by the Subcontracts, or pursuing legal action to enforce the <br>
				  insurance requirements.  In no event shall Grantee permit a contractor <br>
				  to work under a Subcontract when the Grantee is aware that the <br>
				  contractor is not in compliance with the insurance requirements. As <br>
				  used in this Section, a “first tier” contractor is a contractor with <br>
				  which the Grantee directly enters into a contract.  It does not <br>
				  include a subcontractor with which the contractor enters into a <br>
				  contract.</p>

				“claims made” basis, such as professional liability insurance, the <br>
				contractor shall maintain either “tail” coverage or continuous “claims <br>

				coverage.</p>

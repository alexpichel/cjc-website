	<p><strong>Justice Reinvestment Funds 10% for Community-Based Victim Services</strong></p>

	<p>While nearly half the country has engaged in a Justice Reinvestment processes, Oregon is the first state to dedicate at least 10% of Justice Reinvestment funds to victim services programs. HB 3194 specifically stated that funding would be directed to community-based victim services. This FAQ will answer questions you may have about that funding.</p>

	<p><strong>What are Community-based Nonprofit Victim Services Programs?</strong></p>

	<p>Community-based nonprofit victim services programs provide comprehensive services to victims, such as accessing safe emergency shelter, crisis counseling, court and medical accompaniment, safety planning, obtaining protective orders, and applying for benefits. Programs may also provide support groups, assistance in returning to school, finding living wage jobs, support finding safe and affordable housing, family support services, and prevention classes.</p>

	<p>Services are available before, during, and after a criminal case. Services are also available if the victim hasn't reported to law enforcement and if there is no criminal case at all.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p><strong>Community-base Victim Services</strong></p>

		<ul>
			<li>Assist victims who report the crime as well as victims who do not</li>
			<li>Provide advocacy to help victims rebuild their lives (crisis line; emergency shelter; crisis counseling; safety planning; support groups; education and violence prevention; advocacy; assistance navigating criminal justice, civil justice and human services processes)</li>
			<li>Services are focused on victim safety, empowerment, and restoration</li>
			<li>Services are available on an on-going basis</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>System-based Victim Services</strong></p>

		<ul>
			<li>Assist victims whose cases are processed through the justice system</li>
			<li>Provides advocacy to help victims access their rights (information; notification of court proceedings; court accompaniment; assistance with victim impact statements, restitution and applying for compensation)</li>
			<li>Services are focused on victim safety and access to justice system and case-specific information</li>
			<li>Services are typically limited to the duration of the criminal justice process</li>
		</ul>
	</blockquote>

	<p><strong>What are examples of community-based victim services?</strong></p>

	<p>Community-based victim services should have serving victims of crime as part of their mission statement. Examples of community-based nonprofit victim services programs include domestic and sexual violence services programs, services for murder victim family members, assistance for victims of DUII-related crashes, services for child victims, and restorative justice programs (if appropriate).</p>

	<p><strong>Is the 10% tied to the Justice Reinvestment offender population?</strong></p>

	<p>No. Crime victims served through the 10% are not expected to be tied to or the victims of offenders who are part of the HB 3194 population or are being served through Justice Reinvestment. This is an opportunity to provide innovative services to underserved crime victims in your community.</p>

	<p><strong>Can system-based victim services programs receive funding through the 10%?</strong></p>

	<p>No, but system-based victim services programs can receive funding through the other 90% of their County's Justice Reinvestment award.</p>

	<p><strong>How are applications for the 10% evaluated?</strong></p>

	<p>Each grant application will be evaluated based ont he following <em>(JR Grant Rules 213-060-0060(2)(f))</em>:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Demonstrated need for the proposed services in the community to be served by the applicant with emphasis on services that target marginalized, underserved populations.</li>
		<li>Services address access barriers, such as but not limited to: language, literacy, disability, cultural practices and transportation issues.</li>
		<li>Funding increases capacity for areas where services are difficult to access, limited or non-existent.</li>
		<li>Demonstration that the award will be invested in trauma-informed services.</li>
		<li>Data collection, including but not limited to, demographic information of victims served.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>How do I find a community-based nonprofit victim services program that serves my county?</strong></p>
